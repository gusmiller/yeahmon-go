## Social Network API Description

This past week has been all about mongodb. Mongo is a very common NOSql Database out in the market And it is the choice number one for social network applications. NoSQL Databases are non relational databases, designed for applications that need low latency and flexible models to manage large data volumes. 

It is because it is fast, reliable and very flexible. It can handle large volumes of data at high-speed, store unstructure, semi structured and even structured data.

This week's assignment is to build a social network API that would allow users share thoughts or react to friends thoughts and even create a friend's list. The application won't have an interface because it is an API Therefore we would rely on insomnia to access and create records.

Here is my product!
